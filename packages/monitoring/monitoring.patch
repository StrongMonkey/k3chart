> # prometheus-operator
> 
> Installs [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) to create/configure/manage Prometheus clusters atop Kubernetes. This chart includes multiple components and is suitable for a variety of use-cases.
> 
> The default installation is intended to suit monitoring a kubernetes cluster the chart is deployed onto. It closely matches the kube-prometheus project.
> - [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)
> - [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
> - [alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/)
> - [node-exporter](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-node-exporter)
> - [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/kube-state-metrics)
> - [grafana](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana)
> - service monitors to scrape internal kubernetes components
>   - kube-apiserver
>   - kube-scheduler
>   - kube-controller-manager
>   - etcd
>   - kube-dns/coredns
>   - kube-proxy
> 
> With the installation, the chart also includes dashboards and alerts.
> 
> The same chart can be used to run multiple prometheus instances in the same cluster if required. To achieve this, the other components need to be disabled - it is necessary to run only one instance of prometheus-operator and a pair of alertmanager pods for an HA configuration.
> 
> ## TL;DR;
> 
> ```console
> $ helm install stable/prometheus-operator
> ```
> 
> ## Introduction
> 
> This chart bootstraps a [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.  The chart can be installed multiple times to create separate Prometheus instances managed by Prometheus Operator.
> 
> ## Prerequisites
>   - Kubernetes 1.10+ with Beta APIs
>   - Helm 2.12+ (If using Helm < 2.14, [see below for CRD workaround](#Helm-fails-to-create-CRDs))
> 
> ## Installing the Chart
> 
> To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:
> 
> ```console
> $ helm install --name my-release stable/prometheus-operator
> ```
> 
> The command deploys prometheus-operator on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.
> 
> The default installation includes Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager, Grafana, and configuration for scraping Kubernetes infrastructure.
> 
> ## Uninstalling the Chart
> 
> To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:
> 
> ```console
> $ helm delete my-release
> ```
> 
> The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
> 
> CRDs created by this chart are not removed by default and should be manually cleaned up:
> 
> ```console
> kubectl delete crd prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com
> kubectl delete crd prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com
> kubectl delete crd servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
> kubectl delete crd podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
> kubectl delete crd alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com
> ```
> 
> ## Work-Arounds for Known Issues
> 
> ### Running on private GKE clusters
> When Google configure the control plane for private clusters, they automatically configure VPC peering between your Kubernetes cluster’s network and a separate Google managed project. In order to restrict what Google are able to access within your cluster, the firewall rules configured restrict access to your Kubernetes pods. This means that in order to use the webhook component with a GKE private cluster, you must configure an additional firewall rule to allow the GKE control plane access to your webhook pod.
> 
> You can read more information on how to add firewall rules for the GKE control plane nodes in the [GKE docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules)
> 
> Alternatively, you can disable the hooks by setting `prometheusOperator.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false`.
> 
> ### Helm fails to create CRDs
> You should upgrade to Helm 2.14 + in order to avoid this issue. However, if you are stuck with an earlier Helm release you should instead use the following approach: Due to a bug in helm, it is possible for the 5 CRDs that are created by this chart to fail to get fully deployed before Helm attempts to create resources that require them. This affects all versions of Helm with a [potential fix pending](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5112). In order to work around this issue when installing the chart you will need to make sure all 5 CRDs exist in the cluster first and disable their previsioning by the chart:
> 
> 1. Create CRDs
> ```console
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.37/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_alertmanagers.yaml
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.37/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_podmonitors.yaml
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.37/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.37/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheusrules.yaml
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.37/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml
> kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.37/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_thanosrulers.yaml
> 
> ```
> 
> 2. Wait for CRDs to be created, which should only take a few seconds
> 
> 3. Install the chart, but disable the CRD provisioning by setting `prometheusOperator.createCustomResource=false`
> ```console
> $ helm install --name my-release stable/prometheus-operator --set prometheusOperator.createCustomResource=false
> ```
> 
> ## Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version
> 
> A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an
> incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.
> 
> ### Upgrading from 7.x.x to 8.x.x
> Due to new template functions being used in the rules in version 8.x.x of the chart, an upgrade to Prometheus Operator and Prometheus is necessary in order to support them.
> First, upgrade to the latest version of 7.x.x
> ```sh
> helm upgrade <your-release-name> stable/prometheus-operator --version 7.4.0
> ```
> Then upgrade to 8.x.x
> ```sh
> helm upgrade <your-release-name> stable/prometheus-operator
> ```
> Minimal recommended Prometheus version for this chart release is `2.12.x`
> 
> ### Upgrading from 6.x.x to 7.x.x
> Due to a change in grafana subchart, version 7.x.x now requires Helm >= 2.12.0.
> 
> ### Upgrading from 5.x.x to 6.x.x
> Due to a change in deployment labels of kube-state-metrics, the upgrade requires `helm upgrade --force` in order to re-create the deployment. If this is not done an error will occur indicating that the deployment cannot be modified:
> 
> ```
> invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{MatchLabels:map[string]string{"app.kubernetes.io/name":"kube-state-metrics"}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable
> ```
> If this error has already been encountered, a `helm history` command can be used to determine which release has worked, then `helm rollback` to the release, then `helm upgrade --force` to this new one
> 
> ## prometheus.io/scrape
> The prometheus operator does not support annotation-based discovery of services, using the `serviceMonitor` CRD in its place as it provides far more configuration options. For information on how to use servicemonitors, please see the documentation on the coreos/prometheus-operator documentation here: [Running Exporters](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/running-exporters.md)

> ## PrometheusRules Admission Webhooks
> 
> With Prometheus Operator version 0.30+, the core Prometheus Operator pod exposes an endpoint that will integrate with the `validatingwebhookconfiguration` Kubernetes feature to prevent malformed rules from being added to the cluster.
> 
> ### How the Chart Configures the Hooks
> A validating and mutating webhook configuration requires the endpoint to which the request is sent to use TLS. It is possible to set up custom certificates to do this, but in most cases, a self-signed certificate is enough. The setup of this component requires some more complex orchestration when using helm. The steps are created to be idempotent and to allow turning the feature on and off without running into helm quirks.
> 1. A pre-install hook provisions a certificate into the same namespace using a format compatible with provisioning using end-user certificates. If the certificate already exists, the hook exits.
> 2. The prometheus operator pod is configured to use a TLS proxy container, which will load that certificate.
> 3. Validating and Mutating webhook configurations are created in the cluster, with their failure mode set to Ignore. This allows rules to be created by the same chart at the same time, even though the webhook has not yet been fully set up - it does not have the correct CA field set.
> 4. A post-install hook reads the CA from the secret created by step 1 and patches the Validating and Mutating webhook configurations. This process will allow a custom CA provisioned by some other process to also be patched into the webhook configurations. The chosen failure policy is also patched into the webhook configurations
> 
> ### Alternatives
> It should be possible to use [jetstack/cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) if a more complete solution is required, but it has not been tested.
> 
> ### Limitations
> Because the operator can only run as a single pod, there is potential for this component failure to cause rule deployment failure. Because this risk is outweighed by the benefit of having validation, the feature is enabled by default.
> 
> ## Developing Prometheus Rules and Grafana Dashboards
> 
> This chart Grafana Dashboards and Prometheus Rules are just a copy from coreos/prometheus-operator and other sources, synced (with alterations) by scripts in [hack](hack) folder. In order to introduce any changes you need to first [add them to the original repo](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus/blob/master/docs/developing-prometheus-rules-and-grafana-dashboards.md) and then sync there by scripts.
> 
> ## Further Information
> 
> For more in-depth documentation of configuration options meanings, please see
> - [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)
> - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
> - [Grafana](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana#grafana-helm-chart)
> 
> # Migrating from coreos/prometheus-operator chart
> 
> The multiple charts have been combined into a single chart that installs prometheus operator, prometheus, alertmanager, grafana as well as the multitude of exporters necessary to monitor a cluster.
> 
> There is no simple and direct migration path between the charts as the changes are extensive and intended to make the chart easier to support.
> 
> The capabilities of the old chart are all available in the new chart, including the ability to run multiple prometheus instances on a single cluster - you will need to disable the parts of the chart you do not wish to deploy.
> 
> You can check out the tickets for this change [here](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/issues/592) and [here](https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/6765).
> 
> ## High-level overview of Changes
> The chart has 3 dependencies, that can be seen in the chart's requirements file:
> https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/prometheus-operator/requirements.yaml
> 
> ### Node-Exporter, Kube-State-Metrics
> These components are loaded as dependencies into the chart. The source for both charts is found in the same repository. They are relatively simple components.
> 
> ### Grafana
> The Grafana chart is more feature-rich than this chart - it contains a sidecar that is able to load data sources and dashboards from configmaps deployed into the same cluster. For more information check out the [documentation for the chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana)
> 
> ### Coreos CRDs
> The CRDs are provisioned using crd-install hooks, rather than relying on a separate chart installation. If you already have these CRDs provisioned and don't want to remove them, you can disable the CRD creation by these hooks by passing `prometheusOperator.createCustomResource=false` (not required if using Helm v3).
> 
> ### Kubelet Service
> Because the kubelet service has a new name in the chart, make sure to clean up the old kubelet service in the `kube-system` namespace to prevent counting container metrics twice.
> 
> ### Persistent Volumes
> If you would like to keep the data of the current persistent volumes, it should be possible to attach existing volumes to new PVCs and PVs that are created using the conventions in the new chart. For example, in order to use an existing Azure disk for a helm release called `prometheus-migration` the following resources can be created:
> ```
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: PersistentVolume
> metadata:
>   name: pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
> spec:
>   accessModes:
>   - ReadWriteOnce
>   azureDisk:
>     cachingMode: None
>     diskName: pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
>     diskURI: /subscriptions/f5125d82-2622-4c50-8d25-3f7ba3e9ac4b/resourceGroups/sample-migration-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
>     fsType: ""
>     kind: Managed
>     readOnly: false
>   capacity:
>     storage: 1Gi
>   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
>   storageClassName: prometheus
>   volumeMode: Filesystem
> ```
> ```
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
> metadata:
>   labels:
>     app: prometheus
>     prometheus: prometheus-migration-prometheus
>   name: prometheus-prometheus-migration-prometheus-db-prometheus-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
>   namespace: monitoring
> spec:
>   accessModes:
>   - ReadWriteOnce
>   dataSource: null
>   resources:
>     requests:
>       storage: 1Gi
>   storageClassName: prometheus
>   volumeMode: Filesystem
>   volumeName: pvc-prometheus-migration-prometheus-0
> status:
>   accessModes:
>   - ReadWriteOnce
>   capacity:
>     storage: 1Gi
> ```
> 
> The PVC will take ownership of the PV and when you create a release using a persistent volume claim template it will use the existing PVCs as they match the naming convention used by the chart. For other cloud providers similar approaches can be used.
> 
> ### KubeProxy
> 
> The metrics bind address of kube-proxy is default to `127.0.0.1:10249` that prometheus instances **cannot** access to. You should expose metrics by changing `metricsBindAddress` field value to `0.0.0.0:10249` if you want to collect them.
> 
> Depending on the cluster, the relevant part `config.conf` will be in ConfigMap `kube-system/kube-proxy` or `kube-system/kube-proxy-config`. For example:
> 
> ```
> kubectl -n kube-system edit cm kube-proxy
> ```
> 
> ```
> apiVersion: v1
> data:
>   config.conf: |-
>     apiVersion: kubeproxy.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
>     kind: KubeProxyConfiguration
>     # ...
>     # metricsBindAddress: 127.0.0.1:10249
>     metricsBindAddress: 0.0.0.0:10249
>     # ...
>   kubeconfig.conf: |-
>     # ...
> kind: ConfigMap
> metadata:
>   labels:
>     app: kube-proxy
>   name: kube-proxy
>   namespace: kube-system
> ```

> # Grafana Helm Chart
> 
> * Installs the web dashboarding system [Grafana](http://grafana.org/)
> 
> ## TL;DR;
> 
> ```console
> $ helm install stable/grafana
> ```
> 
> ## Installing the Chart
> 
> To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:
> 
> ```console
> $ helm install --name my-release stable/grafana
> ```
> 
> ## Uninstalling the Chart
> 
> To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:
> 
> ```console
> $ helm delete my-release
> ```
> 
> The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
> 
> ## Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version
> 
> A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an
> incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.
> 
> ### To 4.0.0 (And 3.12.1)
> 
> This version requires Helm >= 2.12.0.
> 
> ### To 5.0.0
> 
> You have to add --force to your helm upgrade command as the labels of the chart have changed.

> - extraVolumeMounts:
>   - name: plugins
>     mountPath: /var/lib/grafana/plugins

>     existingClaim: existing-grafana-claim
>     readOnly: false
> ```
> 
> ## Import dashboards
> 
> There are a few methods to import dashboards to Grafana. Below are some examples and explanations as to how to use each method:
> 
> ```yaml
> dashboards:
>   default:
>     some-dashboard:
>       json: |
>         {
>           "annotations":
> 
>           ...
>           # Complete json file here
>           ...
> 
>           "title": "Some Dashboard",
>           "uid": "abcd1234",
>           "version": 1
>         }
>     custom-dashboard:
>       # This is a path to a file inside the dashboards directory inside the chart directory
>       file: dashboards/custom-dashboard.json
>     prometheus-stats:
>       # Ref: https://grafana.com/dashboards/2
>       gnetId: 2
>       revision: 2
>       datasource: Prometheus
>     local-dashboard:
>       url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/master/dashboards/dashboard.json
> ```
> 
> ## BASE64 dashboards
> 
> Dashboards could be storaged in a server that does not return JSON directly and instead of it returns a Base64 encoded file (e.g. Gerrit)
> A new parameter has been added to the url use case so if you specify a b64content value equals to true after the url entry a Base64 decoding is applied before save the file to disk.
> If this entry is not set or is equals to false not decoding is applied to the file before saving it to disk.
> 
> ### Gerrit use case:
> Gerrit API for download files has the following schema: https://yourgerritserver/a/{project-name}/branches/{branch-id}/files/{file-id}/content where {project-name} and
> {file-id} usualy has '/' in their values and so they MUST be replaced by %2F so if project-name is user/repo, branch-id is master and file-id is equals to dir1/dir2/dashboard
> the url value is https://yourgerritserver/a/user%2Frepo/branches/master/files/dir1%2Fdir2%2Fdashboard/content
> 
> ## Sidecar for dashboards
> 
> If the parameter `sidecar.dashboards.enabled` is set, a sidecar container is deployed in the grafana
> pod. This container watches all configmaps (or secrets) in the cluster and filters out the ones with
> a label as defined in `sidecar.dashboards.label`. The files defined in those configmaps are written
> to a folder and accessed by grafana. Changes to the configmaps are monitored and the imported
> dashboards are deleted/updated.
> 
> A recommendation is to use one configmap per dashboard, as a reduction of multiple dashboards inside
> one configmap is currently not properly mirrored in grafana.
> 
> Example dashboard config:
> ```
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: ConfigMap
> metadata:
>   name: sample-grafana-dashboard
>   labels:
>      grafana_dashboard: "1"
> data:
>   k8s-dashboard.json: |-
>   [...]
> ```
> 
> ## Sidecar for datasources
> 
> If the parameter `sidecar.datasources.enabled` is set, an init container is deployed in the grafana
> pod. This container lists all secrets (or configmaps, though not recommended) in the cluster and
> filters out the ones with a label as defined in `sidecar.datasources.label`. The files defined in
> those secrets are written to a folder and accessed by grafana on startup. Using these yaml files,
> the data sources in grafana can be imported. The secrets must be created before `helm install` so
> that the datasources init container can list the secrets.
> 
> Secrets are recommended over configmaps for this usecase because datasources usually contain private
> data like usernames and passwords. Secrets are the more appropriate cluster ressource to manage those.
> 
> Example datasource config adapted from [Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#example-datasource-config-file):
> ```
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: Secret
> metadata:
>   name: sample-grafana-datasource
>   labels:
>      grafana_datasource: "1"
> type: Opaque
> stringData:
>   datasource.yaml: |-

> kube-state-metrics is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects.
> The exposed metrics can be found here:
> https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/README.md#exposed-metrics
> 
> The metrics are exported on the HTTP endpoint /metrics on the listening port.
> In your case, {{ template "kube-state-metrics.fullname" . }}.{{ template "kube-state-metrics.namespace" . }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}/metrics
> 
> They are served either as plaintext or protobuf depending on the Accept header.
> They are designed to be consumed either by Prometheus itself or by a scraper that is compatible with scraping a Prometheus client endpoint.

> # Prometheus Node Exporter
> 
> * Installs prometheus [node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
> 
> ## TL;DR;
> 
> ```console
> $ helm install stable/prometheus-node-exporter
> ```
> 
> ## Introduction
> 
> This chart bootstraps a prometheus [node exporter](http://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.
> 
> ## Installing the Chart
> 
> To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:
> 
> ```console
> $ helm install --name my-release stable/prometheus-node-exporter
> ```
> 
> The command deploys node exporter on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.
> 
> ## Uninstalling the Chart
> 
> To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:
> 
> ```console
> $ helm delete my-release
> ```
> 
> The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
> 
> ## Configuration
> 
> The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Node Exporter chart and their default values.
